## Past Updates

Here you will find a collection of our past updates.

* *March 8:* We made our last daily update on March 7 (containing infections estimates through February 21, 2021). Read Youyang Gu's [One Year Later](https://youyanggu.com/blog/one-year-later) blog post for a detailed explanation and for a list of alternate resources. Follow [@youyanggu](https://twitter.com/youyanggu) on Twitter for continued COVID-19 insights. Thank you for your support over the past year. See our downloadable data [on GitHub](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-infection-estimates-latest).
* *February 26:* After almost a year since *covid19-projections.com* was launched, we will be making the last daily update on Sunday, March 7. See Youyang's blog post [here](https://youyanggu.com/blog/one-year-later).
* *February 24:* See our [latest thoughts](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1364627872233750543) on why we expect a return to normal by summer.
* *February 22:* See our latest analysis on the [impact of in-person university instruction](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1363920593192681476) on community transmission.
* *February 18:* See our thoughts on the UK B.1.1.7 variant [here](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1362476060907077636).
* *February 17:* Is political leaning a better predictor of the severity of the fall 2020 wave than existing immunity and levels of intervention? See our latest findings [here](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1362109356481933312).
* *February 11:* See [our latest thoughts](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1359941463757516802) on why the recent attention on herd immunity may be overblown, and why we should shift our focus away from this topic. [Our modeling](/path-to-herd-immunity) suggests that it is increasingly unlikely that we will reach theoretical herd immunity in 2021.
* *January 28:* We are releasing raw and adjusted CDC vaccination time series data for download [on GitHub](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-cdc-vaccination-data). It contains every CDC vaccination update since they started releasing data on Dec 20, 2020.
* *January 25:* In December, we reported on why the CDC [overestimates true infections](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1344002411556339712) in the US. They have since [adjusted their estimates](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1353803329814503425), which now closely matches *covid19-projections.com*.
* *January 20:* Our new [county-level summary](/infections/summary-counties) page is now searchable, allowing for fast lookup of specific counties. Originally created on Jan 5, we present the best and worst-impacted counties in a sortable, downloadable table format.
* *January 14:* We broke down vaccine doses administered into 1st and 2nd doses. You can find this on our [Path to Herd Immunity](/path-to-herd-immunity) page, or on all of our plots.
* *January 12:* We added vaccination plots to the infections page for every US state (and nationally) based on the latest [CDC data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations). For example, see the vaccination progress for the [US](/infections/us). Scroll down or [click here](#view-us-infections-estimates) to find your state. See a map of the vaccination progress for all 50 states [here](/maps-infections).
* *January 7:* See our [new thread](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1347266544946929665) for an analysis of existing COVID-19 population immunity and its correlation with the severity of this current wave. 
* *January 5:* We made a major update to our [Path to Herd Immunity](/path-to-herd-immunity) page, incorporating the latest vaccination data from the CDC and preliminary information on the new COVID-19 strain.
* *December 29:* See why our total infected estimates [differ from the CDC](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1344002411556339712).
* *December 16:* See our analysis of the effectiveness of the [Kansas mask mandate](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1339306972189843456).
* *December 14:* I've self-funded this project over the past 9 months. [Donate](/donate) to help me keep *covid19-projections.com* running.
* *December 9:* See our latest writeup, [Path to Herd Immunity: 2021 Outlook of COVID-19 in the US](/path-to-herd-immunity), which models how the COVID-19 vaccine can help the US achieve herd immunity.
* *November 25:* We have released a writeup of our methodology: [Estimating True Infections Revisited: A Simple Nowcasting Model to Estimate Prevalent Cases in the US](/estimating-true-infections-revisited).
* *November 23:* We released detailed county-by-county estimates for every US county. You can view them [below](#us-counties-infections-estimates). You can view maps of these estimates on the new [Maps](/maps-infections) page.
* *November 18:* We are re-launching this website with nowcasting of infections estimates in the US (what has happened/is happening). You can download all of our estimates [here](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-infection-estimates-latest).
* *November 2:* Our final October 5 projections estimated 231,000 (221-245k) US deaths by November 1, 2020. The true November 1 death toll was 230,995 (as reported by Johns Hopkins University). See how our final forecasts tracked the true results [here](/about/#comparison-of-october-us-projections). See our updated historical performance [here](/about/#historical-performance).
* *October 5:* We have released our final update. [Read Youyang Gu's blog post](https://youyanggu.com/blog/six-months-later) to read more about this decision. See our [Weekly Update on Twitter](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1313564063679614982). Thank you for your support over the past six months.
* *August 27:* See a comprehensive list of our past Twitter threads [here](/about/#twitter-threads).
* *August 10:* See our [new findings](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1292898685173534722) regarding the role of immunity, behavior, and interventions in the spread of COVID-19. We use Louisiana as a case study.
* *August 5:* We released a report, *[Estimating True Infections: A Simple Heuristic to Measure Implied Infection Fatality Rate](/estimating-true-infections)* that explains our findings regarding the relationship between true infections, reported cases, test positivity rate, and infection fatality rate for COVID-19. You can view a summary on [our Twitter](https://twitter.com/youyanggu/status/1291092311045283841).
* *June 24:* We have open-sourced our [SEIR simulator](https://github.com/youyanggu/yyg-seir-simulator). This is the underlying SEIR model without the machine learning layer to learn the parameters. If your system supports Python, you can generate your own simulations in under 5 minutes. No prior Python experience is needed.
* *June 16:* We have open-sourced our code to [evaluate COVID-19 models](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-forecast-hub-evaluation). The goal of this project is to evaluate various models' historical point forecasts in a transparent, rigorous, and non-biased manner.
* *April 5:* *covid19-projections.com* launched.
