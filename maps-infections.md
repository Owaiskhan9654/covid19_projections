## Maps

### Announcement: We made our last daily update on March 7, 2021. Read more [here](https://youyanggu.com/blog/one-year-later).

Here you will find maps of our infection estimates. If you're viewing from a mobile device, we recommend viewing these maps on the browser or in landscape mode.

To see how the values change over time, drag the slider at the bottom of each map (if on mobile, touch a date).

For county-level maps, visit the links below:
* [US Counties Currently Infected](/infections/map_county_current_infected) \| [Time Lapse](/infections/map_slider_county_current_infected) (may take a while to load)
* [US Counties Total Infected](/infections/map_county_total_infected) \| [Time Lapse](/infections/map_slider_county_total_infected) (may take a while to load)
* *Note: Some Utah counties do not have infections estimates available because they report cases by [local health departments](https://ualhd.org/) rather than by county.*

*Looking for the old (pre-November 2020) iteration of the Maps page? [Click here](/maps).*
