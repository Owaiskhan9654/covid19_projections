## Summary - US Counties

### Note: We made our last daily update on March 7, 2021, and this page is no longer actively maintained. Read more [here](https://youyanggu.com/blog/one-year-later).

View and sort counties by newly infected, currently infected (default), and total infected. You can also copy, download, or print the data. For the full data, see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-infection-estimates-latest/blob/main/counties/1_latest_percent_infected_counties.csv). Raw historical county estimates are also available on our Github: [here](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-infection-estimates-latest/tree/main/counties) or [here](https://github.com/youyanggu/covid19-datasets).

*Data source: [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/) and [Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). Due to the inherent lag in the reporting of cases, our estimates of infections is for 14 days ago. Our infections estimates include all infected individuals of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is several times greater than the number of confirmed cases. Dynamic table generated using [csvtotable](https://github.com/vividvilla/csvtotable).*
